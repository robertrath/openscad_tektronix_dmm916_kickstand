Tektronix DMM916 Kickstand

Replacement kickstand for Tektronix digital  multimeter DMM916

My Tektronix digitial multimeter has a flexible plastic shock cover
with an integrated kickstand. As the lugs had brocken off the original 
kickstand I decided to print a new one.

Depending on your printer and material you can choose to generate
a single piece or instead print 3 pieces with no overhang which
can be glued together.

Note that as the middle part comprises three separated sections it will
be easiest to leave them attached to the print bed and glue on part 1
before removal from the printer.
